1.What is the importance of proper communication.
	
	Communication is a very important aspect in life. Proper communication is helpful for explaining our thoughts and ideas to others very clearly. If we have good knowledge about our work, But lack of communication skills then we can't share our knowledge with others and can't explain our ideas with others properly.
	If we do anything, communication is the basic step. Some people can't explain their ideas due to lack of communication and somebody due to being afraid of others. Excellent knowledge is not enough to reach a good position in life and, only communication is not enough to do  anything. If we have both communication skills and knowledge then we can succeed in anywhere in the world.
	If we don't have proper communication skills then we may face challenges or difficulties in any situation. If we want to express yourself with others freely then we need good communication skills. Relationships also depend upon the communication. If we talk with others in polite manner then they will stay with you otherwise they may leave you.
	So, proper communication is very important to do anything in life.
