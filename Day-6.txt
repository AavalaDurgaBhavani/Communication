1. Why Continuous Learning is important?
	Continuous Learning is important because we would learn all the trending technologies related to our role and go to the job if we are selected for that job related to our course. Then we can work for that job effectively by using trending technologies.
After a few years, some new technologies may come to the market and become trending. If we know current trending technologies and start learning those technologies, then our job is secure and we can effectively and quickly complete our work by using new technologies , and there is a chance to get a high salary for that . There are a lot of opportunities for new technologies in the market.
Otherwise, if you stop learning after getting a job, when new technologies come, then you may not complete your work properly and quickly by using old technologies because you only know the previous technologies. At that time, there is a chance of losing your job and a lack of opportunities for past technologies in the market.
That is the reason continuous learning is important for securing our job, increasing our salaries, getting to higher positions in a job, and leading a better life.
